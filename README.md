# Covid Data Analysis And Real Time monitoring

## Abstract 
As the world struggles with the pandemic, It is of utmost importance that we keep people
well informed about the status of the pandemic and find patterns in the data to gain new
insights and look for solutions. This Project aims to do both, Real Time Monitoring of the
Pandemic and Analysis of the data collected so far from various popular datasets. We will
also be building models using advanced ML algorithms for various use cases like time
series forecasting and predicting the number of confirmed cases. Apache Spark along with
its libraries and Kafka will be the key technologies used.
